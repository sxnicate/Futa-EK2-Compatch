 #### Dungeon Crawler

 futa_ruins_events.1000.title: "Dungeon Crawler"
 futa_ruins_events.1000.desc: "During our investigation, we are suddenly startled by a loud crashing noise. Thinking that it's probably a wild animal, we cautiously start approaching the direction of the sound, weapons ready.\n\nWe reach the small opening the sound came from. What we saw here was not an animal, but a person, sitting firmly on her bottom!\n\n“Oh, hello there! I fell down while trying to retrieve something from the shelf over there. Sorry if I scared y'all! I was just exploring this place! I'm assuming you are here to do the same? Don't worry, there seems to be plenty of valuables around here, I don't mind sharing!”\n\nYour party is a little taken aback by this energetic and bubbly woman. In no time she is back on her feet, rubbing her behind. “Pleased to meet'cha!”\n\nShe seems to have managed to amass a decent haul. You #EMP could liberate#! her from her spoils, or you could leave the fellow adventurer be. There also might be something she is hiding..."

 futa_ruins_events.1001.desc: "You are not sure if you can completely trust this random person that somehow showed up in this long-abandoned place. After all, you haven't seen #EMP any#! recent signs of life around these parts. Just who is she?\n\n"

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_failed_desc: "You start to poke and prod at her to find any trace of deceit in her words and demeanor.\n\n“I understand your caution, friends! I assure you, I'm here on completely legit and authorized business! I got permission from the local authorities to explore and find any valuables that might remain in this place, for providing them with a cut of the spoils, of course! Here is the seal and letter of proof!”\n\n"
 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_failed_desc_2: "Try as you might, you can't tell if she is telling the truth, or if there is #EMP still#! something she is hiding. Frustrating."
 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_failed_desc_naughty_hint: "You are not sure about the validity of these documents. This place is in such a remote location, barely anyone knows of its existence."
 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_failed_desc_futa_hint: "Is that a hint of a #EMP bulge#! you spy? #EMP How curious#!."

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_she_clean_desc: "$futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_failed_desc$ You do not spot any lies in her explanations and proof. She also seems to be not hiding anything else. She is as clean as they come."

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_desc: "You start to poke and prod at her to find any trace of deceit in her words and demeanor. Just #EMP something#! about her doesn't feel right. You decide to trust your intuition and subtly signal your men to apprehend this woman. You have small talk with her, trying to distract her long enough so that she doesn't realise what is about to happen. In one swift motion, she is quickly taken down to the ground and chained up. She couldn't even find the time to protest!\n\n“Hey! What do you think you're doing?! I had thought that you were fellow honorable adventurers and explorers!”\n\nJust a gut feeling, you tell her. #EMP Something#! just didn't feel right about her and this whole circumstance. After you make #EMP absolute#! sure that she is clean, you'll let her go, you assure her. Turning to your men, you tell them to search her belongings and strip her down to give her a thorough search.\n\n"

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_she_futa_desc: "$futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_desc$Upon hearing your order, she suddenly turns pale.“W-wait! Friends! Pl-please!

I'll also go away, leave everything else to you! #EMP Please!#!\n\nHer previous demeanor has completely disintegrated. She is practically whimpering. You might've found a criminal, judging by her reaction. You join the people looking over her documents and other belongings. Everything actually seems to be in order. Thinking you made a mistake, as you were comtemplating letting her go, you hear multiple #EMP gasps#!. You turn back around to look at the cause. She has been completely stripped down and stands there naked. Have they not seen a naked woman before? Then your eyes fall down to her crotch:\n\nAn #EMP absolutely humongous#! cock stands on the place where you'd not expect a woman to have one! A #EMP $trait_futa$#!. She is crossing her legs, trying to hide the #EMP enormous#! tool in-between her thighs, to no avail. You are not sure how you didn't spot this as soon as you looked at her, even before she was naked! It is #EMP impossible#! to miss!\n\nYour eyes meet hers. All colour has drained from her face, her lips are sealed shut. It is not anger, nor emberassment, but pure #EMP fear#!"

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_she_naughty_desc: "$futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_desc$Upon hearing your order, she turns red.“How #EMP dare#! you! Insulting a pure maiden's honour like this! I really thought you better! Shame!” Well, she knows how to cause scene, doesn't she? No matter. You join the people looking over her documents and other belongings.\n\nAha! These documents, papers and sigils are clearly #EMP fake#!. She also seems to be in possession of some things that could be classified as contraband!\n\nWhen you turn back to face her, she is standing there naked from head to toe. She looks like an ordinary woman, maybe above avarage with more of a toned body and a bit more athletic. Her face is completely flushed red. Whether by anger or emberassment, you can't tell.\n\n“I'm telling y'all, I'm no criminal! Just a woman on adventure! Please, it's getting mighty cold in here!” After I make it clear to her that I am aware of the documents being fake and all the other stuff that is in her possession, she pipes down. “Oh, uh. Y'see I tried to get the permits but they wouldn't listen to me! I was going to pay them back after I had gathered some #EMP evidence#!! Honest!”\n\nNo matter, she is still a criminal, carrying around fake sigils and contraband like these."

 futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_she_naughty_futa_desc: "$futa_ruins_events.1001.investigate_success_desc$Upon hearing your order, she suddenly turns pale.“W-wait! Friends! Pl-please!

I was going to pay them back after I had gathered some look to show them that it's not a waste of time, I swear!”\n\nNo matter, she is still a criminal, carrying around fake sigils and contraband like these. You give the order to strip her down, just in case she is hiding more. The colour completely drains from her face. You tell her that you're doing it to check what she has on her, nothing more but she still begs us to stop and let her go. As soon as her lower garments were taken off, your eyes open as wide as they can:\n\nAn #EMP absolutely humongous#! cock stands on the place where you'd not expect a woman to have one! A #EMP $trait_futa$#!. She is crossing her legs, trying to hide the #EMP enormous#! tool in-between her thighs, to no avail. You are not sure how you didn't spot this as soon as you looked at her, even before she was naked! It is #EMP impossible#! to miss!\n\nYour eyes meet hers. All colour has drained from her face, her lips are sealed shut. #EMP A criminal $trait_futa$! Oh, she is in big, big trouble!#!"

 futa_ruins_events.1002.join_diplo_desc: "“You want me to work with you? Hmmm...” She starts scratching her chin in an over the top way. “You know what? You've convinced me! Y'all look like a trustworthy bunch! I guess I can stick around your crew for a while, it was getting mighty boring exploring alone.”\n\n“Alright, Boss. I'm #EMP preeeety#! sure I cleaned out this area, so where we goin'?”\n\nBoss? What?\n\n“#EMP Yeeeah#! I'm not comfortable with names. You can call me by my name, but I'm just going to call you Boss.

 futa_ruins_events.1002.she_clean_imprison_desc: "“You can't do this to me! I have #EMP every#! right to be here! How #S dare#! you!” She yells as she is dragged out the room in chains.

 futa_ruins_events.1002.she_naughty_imprison_desc: "She says nothing as she is dragged out the room in chains, only gives you cold, piercing look. No matter, she is a criminal, and she will be treated like one."

 futa_ruins_events.1002.she_naughty_futa_imprison_desc: "“#EMP Please! Please! I beg of you! Anything! I'll do anything! Please! Let me go!#!” She whimpers as she is dragged out the room in chains.

Even just by herself, she has managed to amass quite a haul. She must be experienced in this area. These places hold endless potential, and you want every advantage you can get.

Even just by herself, she has managed to amass quite a haul. She must be experienced in this area. These places hold endless potential, and you want every advantage you can get. You also remind her that she is a $trait_futa$ fugitive. She basically has no other choice and this might very well be the only oppurtunity she could ever get.\n\n“A-alright. You've made your case.

 futa_ruins_events.1002.she_dead_desc: "You gather all the valuables around the room and on her person, then give one final look towards her now lifeless body, and resume your investigation."

 futa_ruins_events.1002.she_seduced_desc: "You tell your entourage to leave you alone and you'll join them soon after deciding what to do with her. They can look around for anything valuable in the meantime. After a short while, you are left alone with the $trait_futa$.\n\nYou slowly start walking towards her with a slight swing in your hips. She watches you with fearful, trembling eyes, all the colour in her body still drained from when she got found out.\n\nYou lean in and start whispering in her ear in a sultry voice, while your hand lightly grabs her massive tool. Softly squeezing her shaft and orbs, you tell her just how familiar with her kind you are, planting a kiss on her neck and cheek after every sentence.#S *kiss*#! How great their cocks makes you feel.#S *smooch*#! How impressive their virility is compared to men. #S *kiss*#!\n\nWith your other free hand, you undo her chains and they fall down with a #S *clank*#!.

How your mouth waters everytime you see the bulges of their clothes.#S *smooch*#! How your knees get weak in their presence.#S *kiss*#! How their dicks make their home in your insides.#S *kiss*#!

How you have become their cum-dump and #EMP bitch#!.#S *kiss*#! How you plan on continuing to pump out as many of their offspring as possible. #S *smooch*#!\n\nWith one final wet kiss planted right on the side of her lips, you step back from your “acquaintance” to view your handiwork. Her face is flushed red, her eyes are in a daze and unfocused, her mouth is slight agape, panting ever so slightly. Her girl-cock stands at half-mast, throbbing with each heartbeat, continuos pre-cum oozing from the tip. Looks like you've managed to bring some colour back to her, no traces left of her terrified self.\n\nUsing her state of vulnerability, you tell her that you can help with #EMP all#! her worries and you'll keep her #EMP very#! happy. In turn, you'd like to employ her expertise. If she accepts, she should gather her stuff and meet with your group. As you leave the room, you make sure to entice her further with your child bearing hips.\n\nAfter a while, you see her approaching your group. There is a slight wobble to her walk. When your eyes meet, you give her a wink. Her face gets even redder and she quickly averts her eyes. She stops in front of you, and whimpers: “#EMP I accept.#!”"

 futa_ruins_events.1003.title: "Hermic Revelation"
 futa_ruins_events.1003.desc: "Exploring this desecrated site has revealed all kinds of lost trivia and treasure. Say what you will about tomb raiding, but there is #EMP something#! inherently appealing about reclaiming what has been lost to time. \n\nOr so I had thought. \n\nFound within a sturdy but worn chest was a scroll of parchment. Time has eroded much of what was written, but taking some time to decipher the parts of what remained led to a troubling realisation. \n\n#EMP This scroll speaks of an unheard faith!#! \n\nMy hands tremble. It cannot be a ruse, no one has been in here for centuries or more! Not everything that was written is true, but one could apply the same criticism to our current scriptures. To find something like this… Was it #EMP meant#! to be? \n\nThis mysterious account refers to a Goddess named… #EMP Hermillia?#! Allegedly, she had a prominent following according to the “Festival of Fertility” described. Could these ruins have been associated with her? No one knows of their origin… \n\nBut these are sacrilegious thoughts surely? If this Goddess does indeed exist, it is stated that she beholds the [GetTrait('futa_genetic').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] with love? \n\nNone of this can be true… Can it?"
