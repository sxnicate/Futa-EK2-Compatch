 futa_dynasty_events.1000.desc: "A victory so sweet that it must be saviored, or so my berserkers say. Their bodies bulge with pressure from the #EMP burden#! they are forced to endure. Such brutal conditions for Futanari are also what can allow them to gain near-unatural levels of power should they be able to harness their lewd energy. \n\nHaving done their part, I am in no possition to revent them from finally #EMP unloading#! at the expense of our foes. The poor bastards didn't know what was coming until it was too late. My Futanari were desperate enough that they tore apart mail with their own hands, smashing in shields and breaking bones as they fought to earn themselves some toys. \n\nThe survivors likely wish they were slain, mounted in all manner of #EMP eccentric#! positions and #EMP split apart#! by the sheer mass of ranging she-meat forcing their way inside them. \n\nThe screams are like a war cry all on their own. If my foes were getting any ideas of a second wind I would wager that the anguish of their bretheren would have changed their minds. \n\nIt was not only the soldiers, but the camp followers of the enemy as well. My berserkers sprinted to the backlines in order to prevent any chance of a route, then worked their way to the front, trapping my foe. All the whilst they were pummelling and fucking. \n\nThe battlefield is covered in corpses and living - but dangerously bloated - lost souls."
