 futa_religion_events.0005.desc:0 "#EMP Get it out, get it out of me! Oh Vilecore, purge this Hermillian filth and make it into your servant!#! Your chants echo into the deep of night. You have prepared the ritual as closely to the visions as possible. You got the fire, the location, the time of night, you even crushed one hundred nuts forged from the local area for good measure. \n\nLooking down at your bloated frame fills you with disgust. The Futanari are shameless, but you have no plans on becoming a #EMP broodmother#! For them. \n\n#BOLD *Churn*#! \n\n#EMP Argh!!! What is this… PAIN? ARGGGGGG!#! \n\nYou lurch back against the ground as your body starts to compulse rapidly. It feels as if something is trying to #EMP claw#! It’s way out of you. Chancing a look, you see the surface of your taunt belly bulging and sinking in numerous spots, shifting constantly. \n\nTears cloud your vision from all the pain and discomfort. You feel #EMP wrong#!. Another shrill scream escapes your lips. Breathless, hurt and a little afraid, you brace for what comes next. \n\n#EMP ARGHHHHHHHHH!!!#! \n\nSick wet sounds join your screams as your birthing canal is spread wide. You wriggle and cry, unable to slow down but not wishing to speed up. The large mass inside you begins to decline… \n\n#EMP What is-?!#! \n\nYou might be going delirious, but escaping from your womb is a vast quantity of #EMP inky black#! vapour. Each contraction forces more and more out of you. The feeling is indescribable, but you would not call it pleasant. \n\nYou hear a groan - not from you - near your legs. It is drowned out by yet another scream as the last of your package is expelled. The dark mist swirls around a central figure, coalescing into #EMP something#! more corporeal. \n\nFrom the darkness, a flash of white. Sharp, deadly #EMP teeth!#! \n\n”#EMP Kehkehkehkehkeh!#!” \n\nThe figure wobbles, emitting an unnerving cackle. You try to move away, but you can’t. Your body must recover. You have no choice but to lie and wait, vulnerable and alone. \n\n”He- Hel-  #EMP Hello Mommy#!.” The creature speaks to you. Its voice shrill, like nails with an attitude. At one three large beaming eyes open to behold their new surroundings. Eventually they lock with the two inside your head, and when they do you see a vision of #EMP Vilecore.#! \n\nShe is smiling. You can tell this was the intended result all along. This #EMP creature#! is as much her child as it is your own. A mockery of Hermillia’s creations. It will serve you so long as you keep your pact with Vilecore."

After checking there is no way for the “guest” side to see through to the otherside, I take my seat inside the booth and signal for one of my Futanari Nuns to step inside. She thumbles around for a bit before taking a deep breath and sitting down. “Hello. I have come to make a confession.” \n\nAnominity is an important aspect towards letting an individual open up. The only judgment within this box is God’s. I must do my best not to pry, nor attempt to discover the identity… Even if it is often obvious. \n\n”My mind has been plagued with… Lustful thoughts. They come even when I try to occupy myself with Godly duties.” She sounds slightly frustrated. #EMP Maybe not frustrated enough?#! She should not despair for having these urges, it is unfortunately expected of her nature. You inform the Nun that what truly matters is how she does not act upon those urges and acknowledges them as bad. In time, she will overcome these… Relapses. \n\n”Thank you for saying so. Your words inspire me with confidence that I can live up to be worthy of God’s Kingdom.”"

It makes me feel so good, and I know it would feel better if there was someplace I could stick it inside… Even though that is a sin…” \n\nSuch a dirty mind only has one cure. You remove a seal from the wall that separates the two of you, revealing a hole. Your cock - nice and hard - pushes through. You hear a gasp. \n\n”What are you…?” You tell the Nun that her disgraceful lust has angered God. If she wishes to repent, she shall do so by transferring those wishes for her cock onto your own devout rod. She must pleasure you to an orgasm in lieu of her own, only then can she be deemed whole of mind. \n\n”If that is what it takes… I want to be good.” \n\nYour cock twitches between the Nun’s fingers. She grasps your shaft firmly, trying to imagine it is her own as she starts stroking. A lewd silence takes hold, with only the sounds of her pious handjob filling the booth. \n\nThis is going to take too long unless she picks up the pace. You inform the devotee that to show she truly means to absolve her sins, she should clean your pole. By doing so, she is cleaning up her own shame. \n\n”If that is God’s command… *Spit*” Saliva dampens your glans. The Nun palms her spit against you, slicking your rod with a mixture of precum and drool. That cocktail becomes a lot more concentrated once the Nun opens her mouth and starts sucking on your length. \n\n#EMP Much better…#! You rest your weight on the wall, relaxing your shoulders and taking in the experience. Although you cannot see her, the slurping of your penis on the other side paints a vivid picture in your mind. \n\n#EMP Mmm! Make sure not to waste a drop!#! Your balls tense up and your seed spills, bouncing against the roof of the nun’s mouth on their way down her gullet. \n\n*Cough* *Cough* #EMP Gah!#! You didn’t warn me first?!” \n\nThe nerve to complain after such a mediocre performance. She should be grateful God has given her this chance to apologise for her sins."

Unlike before, the semen stream is gloopier. A greasy congealed mass long past its best. Your Nun croaks. Her pipe clogged up with your expired seed. \n\nStill hard, you stomp into her side of the booth. You find [nun.GetFirstName] clutching at her neck, unsure whether to spit or swallow the blockage. Her eyes shrink from embarrassment when she notices you, but you are not bothered. \n\nYou  grab her head and force her over your penis again, humping away until yet another load of old semen is released, filling her up right to the lips. She has no choice now but to force it down. Her face bright red and eyes watering. \n\nSeeing as it is your duty to guide the Nun’s, you quickie wipe some leftover cum onto [nun.GetFirstName]’s lips before reaching down and finger banging her anus. The stimulation “encourages” the Nun, mumbling away as she swallows the last dregs of stale seed. \n\n”#EMP URRRRRGHH!#!

Those thoughts make me… Happy.” Her degeneracy goes deeper than you feared. #EMP Willingly#! Spreading a curse? God have mercy on her soul. For desperate times like these you installed a secret hatch. Removing it reveals a somewhat large opening. You inform the Nun she must strip and stick her rear through the hole for righteous inspection. \n\n”O-okay?” You listen for the sound of cloth hitting the floor. Soon enough, a round object worm’s its way into your quarters. You take a good look at the rump. A winking hole twitches under your silent gaze. But most importantly, her mark of shame. Her throbbing cock and balls, dangling before you. \n\nYou will purge thoughts of spreading sin by stimulating her sexually… Up the ass. \n\n”#EMP My Ass?!#!” That is correct. No children can come from seeding the anus. God labels such acts as Sin, but when it comes to a Futanari it is righteous. Their procreation is forbidden! Your penis is eager to do it’s duty. You thumb the Nun’s back door to test the resilience before inserting the tip of your rod. \n\n”_Ngh!” You hear a grunt as you spread her open. A smile flickers across your face. This Futanari is offering herself in such a vulnerable position, yet she cannot even see you. Your hips start beating away with that encouraging thought, clapping her cheeks like a drum. \n\n#EMP “Mmm! MM! Ahh, I’m close!”#! Sounds as if your Nun is enjoying her atonement too much. Your eye shifts to her pulsating orbs, ready to spill at any moment. You clutch one in you hand. It is weighty, you can #EMP feel#! The seed surging inside. In tune with your next thrust, you squeeze down on her nut. \n\n”AHHHHHHGHH!” The Nun cries out. #EMP A reminder she is here to repent!#! Your role in that repentance comes to an end, you fill her backdoor with a collection of little worshipers.

The church were welcoming at first, then scrutinous - as they should be - upon learning of my horrific nature. I wasn’t able to speak up before a Nun threw holy water over my face, but afterwards I explained I had arrived for my confession. \n\nA priest directed me into the booth and an anonymous servant of God entered the other side. \n\n”Speak. Tell me of your sins so God might weed them out.” \n\nSpeak I do. Of the impulses. The urges. The desires. Sex. Loved ones. Family. All are a gateway to sin for Futanari. \n\n”You have been quite honest.
