Anything wrong happens with that bottle, and we will be set back years! But, that is also our instrument for the ritual. I even heard some $trait_futa$ are peddling a version of this for a fertility boost too. Users of these are pretty much guaranteed to impregnate, or get pregnant, #EMP no matter their age.#! Though what they use is largely watered down, which allows them to use it recreationally. I prepared the pure distillation to cure your affliction, as anything short of that would not work.”\n\n“Whenever you are ready, pop the vial open and drink what is inside. #BOL However!#! It is #BOL imperative#! you swallow it all in one swift motion. Do not linger, do not stop to inhale and smell what is inside, do not put some in your mouth to taste, do not keep any in your mouth. #BOL All of it needs to be swallowed immediately.#!
