When my brothers would carry me to the river and we would try to catch the fish with our small hands… My home is so distant to me now.#! \n\nSorting through the last of your host’s laundry, your mind torments you with memories of how you were stolen away. The loud bangs that signified a change. Enemies of your father who could not best him and so went after his family. Your eldest brother Kakar was the first to discover their arrival by means of a spear through the chest. You’ve never forgotten how #EMP terrified#! his eyes looked before they shut forever… \n\n#EMP I… I never even got to say goodbye to him. At the time it felt like the worst thing in the world, but Kakar was lucky to have departed so swiftly. Life became punishing. We no longer played in the river. Always in hiding. Always afraid of what might happen next. When they found me I was expecting to join my brother in death… But that would have been too kind.#! \n\nFinished with your task, you rise to your feet and start carrying the loaded basket inside. The sun’s evening ray’s sparkle across your face, but it does little to distract you from the dark thoughts resurfacing within. \n\n#EMP I was taken prisoner. Used to weaken my Father’s resolve. They forced him out of hiding… They killed him in front of me. All of them laughing as he fell. I don’t even remember their twisted faces. Just the laughter.#! \n\n#EMP To think I was born free, only to then end up sold as a slave. With my Father slain his rivals had no need of me. I was shipped away to a far away land and used as a prized object…#! \n\nYou slam the basket down with more force than required, anger driving your movements as you curse the fat man who “owned” you. By the grace of God you were spared his more carnal interests thanks to being so young at the time, but you knew from the looks the older slave girls gave you that privilege wouldn’t last for long. \n\n#EMP It is sinful, but I still have no regrets about my departure. The slaves had enough, and the “master” had grown slothful. It wasn’t hard to silence him when we all held him down to his horrid bed. The woman who finished him had such a wicked smile on her face. The devil favours her for certain, but if not for her where would I be now?#! \n\nYou take a seat outside the house to enjoy the breeze for a while. Your memories carry such heavy burdens, but thankfully you are now in a better place. You had split away from the other slaves and stumbled upon a remote village. For the first time in a long time you were received with kindness. You would later learn they thought someone like you must have been a foreign noble. Perhaps another sin to your name, you allowed this misconception to linger. It does not compensate for your pass, but your time here has allowed you to slowly start healing. You adopted the tongue of the locals and learned their ways. But despite it all, this peace is built on a lie. How long before you are found out and chased away all over again…"

Just leave us be if you have any kindness in your soul.” \n\nYou had forgotten that your wardrobe left little to the imagination as of late. The Futanari clearly perceive you as an agent of some sort. Their body language is closed off and guarded. At the same time, they can’t help but glance at your figure. You notice parts of the clothing have tented up since your arrival. Anxiety begins to grow inside you, but you chose to approach them openly and so you shall remain. Futanari are devils, but does that mean they are beyond salvation? \n\n”Life keeps getting stranger. Gods name me a fool, if you speak true then I would welcome the conversation of one with a level of respect”. Whilst clear still on edge, the Futanari try to settle back into conversation. They explain that a bride-to-be was sexually assaulted in the dead of night at their village and in lue of a culprit, the locals had blamed these women with no evidence beyond being Futanari. They fled along with another, but she apparently deserted them after learning about a rumoured Deity who loved Futanari. \n\nThe topic of faith reminds you of the urgency your own journey must take, and so you let them know it is time for you to depart. \n\n”W-wait!” One of the women quickly blurts out, rising to her feet.

Feeling the many days of rough exploring, you decide to take a rest on a bench beside the building’s walls. \n\nWarm rays of sunlight dance upon your face as you  observe the serenity of nature. It feels as if a huge burden has been lifted from your chest. #EMP This reminds me of the day I set out on this journey. It seems my life has just been one massive trip for one reason or another. Will I ever have a place I can truly call home?#! \n\n… \n\n”-xcuse me, Miss?” \n\n#EMP Huh?#! You appeared to have dozed off for a while. Your eyes open to see a stranger - specifically a woman of the faith - gently shaking you. \n\n”Are you alright? I don’t believe I have seen you around here before?” Her eyes scan your features intently, you quickly realise your current attire is not fit for decent folk. Blushing, you explain that you have been undertaking a long and dangerous journey, which had claimed your clothes along the way. \n\nThe nun gives you a soft chuckle. “I was hoping you would have said something like that”. #EMP HUH?#! “Come. Let us continue this conversation indoors, I should have some spare clothes for you to wear.”"

The Nun - who you learned is called [futa.GetFirstName] - has supplied you with warm drink and comfortable clothes. She has been a most generous host and a good listener. You ended up sharing more about your travels than you ought have done, but you feel completely at ease around her. \n\n”I can tell the trials you have faced have taken a toll on you, but you should know it was for a greater purpose. A higher cause.” \n\n#EMP Does she know about my visions? How?#! \n\n”The truth is my dear, that you were not set upon your quest by God. Well, not the god #EMP you#! are thinking of anyway.” [futa.GetFirstName] begins to reach for her robes, lifting her skirt above her waist. \n\n#EMP !!! She’s a Futanari!#! Your heart rate quickens. You have had more than you share of dangerous encounters with her kind as of late. [futa.GetFirstName] quickly drops her skirt back down. \n\n”Please, I am no threat to you. We serve the same power. I too came here as a result of a vision, although many months ahead of your own.” \n\n#EMP What she is saying is blasphemy. Surely? Why do her words resonate with my soul? Could I have been following the will of another…. My quest did not feel like the sort of trial the bible would have taught…#! \n\n”We have been summoned by the Goddess Hermillia! I see you are surprised. So was I, once upon a time. She is the patron to Futanari and outcasts. Long forgotten to the annals of history. My visions led me down a path of discovering her Faith through what few sources remain. I was instructed to wait for the arrivals of someone #EMP special#!. Someone who would undertake a perilous journey unarmed yet succeed. I believe that someone, to be you.” \n\n#EMP Me? Special? My whole life has felt like anything but. Could she speak true? What does this Hermillia want from me?#! \n\n”The Goddess needs both of us to help bring about her return. We have both been chosen. For our suffering. For our commitment. It has not only shaped us as people, but our very #EMP essence#! as well.” [futa.GetFirstName] steps closer. “She needs us to #EMP conceive#! a child together. One who will grow to champion her cause and change the fate of Futanari across the entire planet!” #EMP WHAT?#! \n\n… \n\nIt is still so overwhelming, but after having some time to sort through your thoughts you have begun to come to terms with [futa.GetFirstName]’s words. You return to her stating you think you are willing, if that is what the Goddess has tasked you with. She smiles. \n\n”Hermillia was clearly correct to place her faith in you. We Futanari are not welcomed by most. I am happy to learn that my destined partner is so compassionate. Know that this is both a great duty and honour. You shall be known as the Mother to the child who shall restore our Goddess to the world!” You feel your cheeks blush. This [futa.GetFirstName] has such a colourful way of seeing the world. \n\n#EMP She seems so lovely, but I barely know anything about her. Even if it turns out I have been following a different God, I am not so quick to lay with someone I just met.#! You ask if you could spend some time getting to know one another. [futa.GetFirstName] smiles back at you. \n\n “Of course. I am sure you would like to learn more about our Goddess… And me.”"

Two women who endured everything the world had thrown at them and made it to be together here on this day. #EMP Of course I am comfortable, I am here with one of the friendliest people this earth has ever known.#! \n\nThe two of you embrace.

You can see the pleasure etched into her over stimulated expression. “This is…” [futa.GetFirstName] starts bucking her hips, her head rolling around as she struggles to formulate her words. “This is… Oh!” \n\nYour rhythm improves as the two of you continue exploring the depths of devotion.

Her expression breathless but engaged as she acknowledges only you. \n\n#EMP *Creek*#! \n\n”Hello? Anyone in here?” \n\n#EMP Oh no! That’s one of the monks!#!"
